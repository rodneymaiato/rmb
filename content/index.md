## Hi, I'm Rod Maiato

I like supporting self-employed creatives and small businesses by handling the boring financial stuff.

With over 10 years as an in-house corporate accountant and four years at the CRA, I have the skills to take care of all your bookkeeping needs and can support you in addressing complex tax matters. 

If you would like to keep creativity flowing without the admin hassle, I'm sure I can help you.

>Ditch the chaos and embrace clarity
